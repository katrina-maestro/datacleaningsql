Layoff Data Cleaning and Standardization

Objective
The objective of this project is to clean, standardize, and prepare the layoff data from the world_layoffs.layoffs table for further analysis. This includes removing duplicate records, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and ensuring consistency in the dataset. Accurate and clean data is essential for reliable analysis and decision-making, especially when dealing with sensitive information like layoffs which can have significant social and economic impacts.

Steps and Processes
1. Removing Duplicate Data
Create a Staging Table:
A staging table layoffs_staging is created as a copy of the original layoffs table to perform operations without altering the original data.

Identify and Mark Duplicates:
Use the ROW_NUMBER() window function to identify duplicate records based on key columns: company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date, stage, country, and funds_raised_millions.

Remove Duplicates:
Delete duplicate rows from the staging table.

2. Standardizing Data
Trim Company Names:
Remove leading and trailing spaces from company names.

Standardize Industry Names:
Normalize industry names, specifically ensuring all variations of 'Crypto' are unified.

Normalize Country Names:
Correct inconsistencies in country names, such as removing trailing periods.

Standardize Date Format:
Convert date strings to SQL DATE format.

3. Handling Null Values
Identify and Update Null Values:
Check and update null or empty fields in critical columns like industry.

Populate Missing Industry Values:
Use existing data to fill in missing industry values for companies based on available information.

4. Remove Unnecessary Data
Delete Uninformative Rows:
Remove rows where both total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off are null, as they provide no useful data.

Drop Unnecessary Columns:
Remove the row_num column after ensuring duplicates are managed.

General Results
Upon completing the data cleaning and standardization process, the layoff data is significantly improved in terms of quality and consistency. The removal of duplicate records ensures that analyses are based on unique and accurate entries. Standardizing the data formats for company names, industry names, country names, and dates reduces variability and enhances the reliability of the dataset. Handling null values and removing uninformative rows ensure that the dataset is as complete and informative as possible. These improvements facilitate more robust and precise analyses, leading to better insights and decision-making based on the layoff data.

By following these steps, we ensure that the layoff data is clean, standardized, and ready for detailed analysis. The processed data will be free from duplicates, consistent in format, and devoid of unnecessary records, making it suitable for further analytical processes and decision-making.
