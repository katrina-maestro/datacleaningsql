# Layoff Data Cleaning and Standardization

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to clean, standardize, and prepare the layoff data from the world_layoffs.layoffs table for further analysis. This includes removing duplicate records, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and ensuring consistency in the dataset. Accurate and clean data is essential for reliable analysis and decision-making, especially when dealing with sensitive information like layoffs which can have significant social and economic impacts.

## Objectives
Remove duplicate entries from the layoff data.
Standardize company, industry, location, and country names.
Convert date formats to a standardized SQL datetime format.
Address and populate null values in critical columns.
Remove unnecessary columns and rows to streamline the dataset.
Methodology
Dependencies: Ensure the necessary SQL environment is set up and accessible.

## Methodology:

Creating Staging Table:
Create a staging table similar to the original "layoffs" table.
Insert data from the original table into the staging table for testing and processing.

Removing Duplicates:
Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to identify and remove duplicate rows based on key columns (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, date, stage, country, funds_raised_millions).
Insert the cleaned data into a new table, "layoffs_staging2".

Standardizing Data:
Trim whitespace from company names.
Standardize industry names by consolidating variations (e.g., different variations of "Crypto").
Standardize country names to avoid discrepancies (e.g., "United States" and "United States.").
Convert date columns to a standard SQL datetime format.

Addressing Null Values:
Identify and populate null values in the "total_laid_off" and "industry" columns by cross-referencing other rows with the same company name.

Cleaning Up:
Remove rows with no layoff data.
Drop unnecessary columns (e.g., "row_num") from the final table.

## Results
Duplicate Removal: Successfully identified and removed duplicate rows, ensuring unique entries in the dataset.
Data Standardization: Company, industry, location, and country names were standardized, improving consistency.
Date Conversion: Date columns were successfully converted to SQL datetime format.
Null Value Handling: Null values in critical columns were addressed, improving data completeness.
Cleanup: Unnecessary rows and columns were removed, streamlining the dataset for analysis.

## Usage Tips
Ensure access to the SQL environment with the necessary permissions to create tables and run update queries.
Use the provided SQL scripts to replicate the ETL process on similar datasets.
